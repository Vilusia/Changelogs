Thank you for using my addon!
This is a simple Changelog addon that allows server owners to provide their users with updates in game. This allows your users to view what you've added
without needing to go to the forums.

Usage: Type /logs or !logs in game to open the menu. Press Add log as admin to create a new log. 
You can delete logs one at a time by pressing the Delete Log button.
You can also save logs by pressing the Save Log button. This will publish the log, allowing users to see it.
If you want to remove everything quickly, navigate to your gmod data/changelogs folder and erase the ones you want.
You can edit almost every color on this addon by going into the config located in the addon autorun fodler.

Installation: Simply drago and drop the master folder into your addon folder and erase the -master that comes with it.
Make sure you restart your server once you add it.

Credits: Scratch(agent766) for helping me with everything related to the saving and loading.
